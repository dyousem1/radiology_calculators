## The RY Metric

A novel bibliometric measure that weights first and last authorship 5× more than middle authorship, distinguishing research leaders from collaborative contributors.

### Formula

```
RY Metric = Weighted Citations + (10 × Weighted Publications)
```

Where:
- **First/Last author contributions** are weighted **5×**
- **Middle author contributions** are weighted **1×**

### Why RY Metric?

Traditional metrics like H-index and total citations don't distinguish between leadership roles (first/last author) and collaborative contributions (middle author). The RY Metric addresses this by rewarding those who lead research projects.
