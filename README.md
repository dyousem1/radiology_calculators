## Analysis Tools

### 🏥 Institution Rankings Lookup (NEW)

Compare any institution's rankings across all 8 subspecialties with 5 different metrics:
- Total Papers
- Total Citations
- Papers Per Faculty
- Mean H-Index
- Median H-Index

---

## Metrics Included

Each calculator provides percentile rankings for:

- **Total Citations**
- **Total Papers**
- **H-Index**
- **First Author Papers**
- **First Author Citations**
- **Last Author Papers**
- **Last Author Citations**
- **RY Metric** ⭐

---

## The RY Metric

A novel bibliometric measure that weights first and last authorship 5× more than middle authorship, distinguishing research leaders from collaborative contributors.

### Formula

```
RY Metric = Weighted Citations + (10 × Weighted Publications)
```

Where:
- **First/Last author contributions** are weighted **5×**
- **Middle author contributions** are weighted **1×**

### Why RY Metric?

Traditional metrics like H-index and total citations don't distinguish between leadership roles (first/last author) and collaborative contributions (middle author). The RY Metric addresses this by rewarding those who lead research projects.
