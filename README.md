## Metrics Included

Each calculator provides percentile rankings for:

- **Total Citations**
- **Total Papers**
- **H-Index**
- **First Author Papers**
- **First Author Citations**
- **Last Author Papers**
- **Last Author Citations**
- **RY Metric** ⭐

---

## The RY Metric

A novel bibliometric measure that weights first and last authorship 5× more than middle authorship, distinguishing research leaders from collaborative contributors.

### Formula

\`\`\`
RY Metric = Weighted Citations + (10 × Weighted Publications)
\`\`\`

Where:
- **First/Last author contributions** are weighted **5×**
- **Middle author contributions** are weighted **1×**

### Why RY Metric?

Traditional metrics like H-index and total citations don't distinguish between leadership roles (first/last author) and collaborative contributions (middle author). The RY Metric addresses this by rewarding those who lead research projects.
